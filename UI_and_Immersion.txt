the name minecraft is more impactful than minebuild because the term craft is more suggestive of creative themes and survivalist themes. 

There are symbols in games which contribute to the game's "character"(not the characters, the personality)

some examples are the gem in sims, the dirt block in minecraft, the heart in undertale

there are also other things which are constant about games:

the day/night cycle in minecraft
the blocks in minecraft
the lack of circles in minecraft
the gray background of the ui and the 2.5D borders around each element

user story - it starts from hearing about the game(from an ad, a friend, a trailer, etc), and includes the purchase process(adding funds, paying, dealing with any bullshit, waiting for the download), making an account, the first time you launch it, and the experience of playing it. This is all immersion.
